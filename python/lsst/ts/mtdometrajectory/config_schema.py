          Maximum difference between dome and telescope azimuth before moving the dome (deg).

  azimuth_vignette_partial:
    description: >-
      Azimuth angle difference (deg) above which the telescope is partially vignetted
      when the telescope is at elevation 0 (horizon). This is approximately 2.7째.

  azimuth_vignette_full:
    description: >-
      Azimuth angle difference (deg) above which the telescope is fully vignetted
      when the telescope is at elevation 0 (horizon). This is approximately 35째
    type: number
  elevation_vignette_partial:
    description: >-
      Elevation angle difference (deg) above which the telescope is partially vignetted.
      This is approximately 1.3째.

    description: >-
      Elevation angle difference (deg) above which the telescope is fully vignetted
      This is approximately 44째.

  shutter_vignette_full:
    description: >-
      Shutter open percentage (%) below which the telescope is fully vignetted.
      This probably needs to be a bit larger than 0, to take into account noise in the reported value
      and/or essentially no light getting through in the last bit of travel.
    type: number
  enable_el_motion:
    description: >-
      Enable elevation motion or not.
      This should be set to False at least for the summit until the dome light and wind screen is supported.
      For BTS and TTS this can be set to True.
